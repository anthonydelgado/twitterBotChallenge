Twitter Bot Coding Challenge

Your mission should you choose to accept it is to create a Twitter bot using Node.JS that replies to @mentions with a tweet containing a related gif from the Giphy Search API.

For example, if you were to tweet "@twitterbot pizza" the bot would reply with something like this:

When you are done push your code to GitHub and link to the Twitter account in the README.md
